## Name

The name of this theme refers to the [*Musaeum* at Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeum) (also called *Mouseion*), the institution housing the [Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria), the arguably most significant ancient library.
In a way, this theme is to your documentation what the *Musaeum* was to the Library of Alexandria.
